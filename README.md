👋 Hi, I’m @Tec-hub-creator
👀 I’m interested in Information Technology and pursuing specific tech skills required by BMW.
🌱 I’m currently learning to use traditional loops and JOptionPane for displaying results in Java programs, mastering ArrayLists in Java, and working on various projects including Swing GUIs, file I/O, data structures, JDBC database operations, multithreading, and client-server applications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any IT-related projects or assignments, especially those involving Java programming.
📫 How to reach me: 076 740 7756, thekoheavystone@gmail.com or IG:hm_theko
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I grew up in a village without much exposure to technology but was inspired by my uncle who works remotely in ICT. I also love lifting weights, going to the gym, and running long distances!
